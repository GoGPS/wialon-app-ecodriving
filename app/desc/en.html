<p>Eco Driving is an app for refined vehicle and driving-behaviour analysis. Estimation will be beased on the following parameters ‒ speed limits violations, harsh acceleration, harsh braking, cornering, and certain custom parameters (sensor data) to be taken into account. The system of norms and standards can be easily adjusted for speficic vehicle types and drivers; and it’s up to integrators to develop their approaches towards penalties/rewards based on Eco Driving results.</p>
